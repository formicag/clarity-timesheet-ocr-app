DESCRIPTION=Approval queue stability fix with ProcessedImages tracking table

# Changelog:
# 2.6.0 (2025-10-27): CRITICAL FIX - Stable approval queue with ProcessedImages tracking
#   - Created ProcessedImages DynamoDB table to track which images have been processed
#   - Replaced unreliable timestamp comparison logic with simple set subtraction
#   - Fixed approval workflow bug where images were never marked as processed
#   - Approval queue now shows exact number of pending images (no more 60→67→70 jumping)
#   - Updated approve endpoint to mark images in ProcessedImages table
#   - Updated reject endpoint to remove from ProcessedImages table (allows rescanning)
#   - Simple logic: Pending = S3 images - ProcessedImages (100% accurate)
#   - Fixes infinite queue loop where same images appeared forever
#   - See APPROVAL_QUEUE_FIX_COMPLETE.md for full technical details
# 2.5.1 (2025-10-27): QUALITY IMPROVEMENT - Automatic duplicate timesheet detection and replacement
#   - Detects when new timesheet upload matches existing person/week in database
#   - Automatically deletes old database entries for that person/week (all 7 days)
#   - Automatically deletes old source S3 images associated with old timesheet
#   - Allows progressive quality improvement by rescanning with better screenshots
#   - Users can rescan dark-mode timesheets in light-mode to replace poor-quality data
#   - Prevents duplicate data accumulation for same person/week periods
#   - Logs all replacement actions for audit trail
# 2.5.0 (2025-10-27): ACCURACY FIX - Automatic column alignment correction and smart bank holiday validation
#   - Added automatic detection and correction of column misalignment errors
#   - Compares daily totals from header against calculated project hour sums
#   - Automatically zeros out days where header=0 but OCR extracted hours (common error)
#   - Flags mismatches that need manual review (header>0 but OCR=0)
#   - Smart bank holiday validation: removes OCR errors on bank holidays while allowing legitimate work
#   - Bank holiday rule: If header=0 on bank holiday, remove any OCR-extracted hours (hallucination)
#   - Bank holiday rule: If header>0 on bank holiday, allow it (legitimate work)
#   - Fixes Neil Pomfret Wed empty column and David Hunt Mon bank holiday errors
#   - Diagnostics show before/after alignment correction
# 2.4.4 (2025-10-27): UI IMPROVEMENT - Added detailed validation display with OCR extracted values
#   - Lambda now returns ocr_extracted_values with daily_totals, weekly_total, and projects
#   - Approval interface displays validation checks in structured table
#   - Shows Week Total (bold, first row), Daily totals (Mon-Sun), Project totals
#   - Each check displays: Type, Item, Calculated hours, OCR Value hours, ✓/✗ indicator
#   - Visual indicators: Green ✓ for matching values, Red ✗ for mismatches
#   - Allows user to verify day totals, project totals, and week total against image
# 2.4.3 (2025-10-27): CRITICAL FIX - Complete anti-hallucination + OCR digit/letter correction
#   - Added project code correction to Gemini extraction path (was missing!)
#   - Load S3 reference dictionary with 32 known project codes
#   - Added letter confusion patterns: S↔5, C↔G (fixes NTCS vs NTC5)
#   - Improved generate_code_variations to handle full alphanumeric codes
#   - Updated reference dictionary with NTCS158600, PJ023827, sps1995
#   - Fixes all 3 Gareth Jones errors: NTC5124690→NTCS158600, PJ022827→PJ023827, etc.
# 2.4.2 (2025-10-27): CRITICAL FIX - Anti-hallucination measures for Gemini OCR
#   - Added temperature=0.0 to Gemini generation config for deterministic output
#   - Added explicit anti-hallucination instructions to prevent cross-image contamination
#   - Enhanced prompt with "READ ONLY THIS IMAGE" instructions
#   - Added ZERO TOLERANCE date accuracy requirements
#   - Added ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULE for project codes (must be visibly present)
#   - Added NTCS and lowercase sps codes to valid project code formats
#   - Fixes issue where Gemini was mixing data from different timesheets
# 2.4.1 (2025-10-27): BUG FIX - Fixed cost calculation crash when USE_GEMINI_OCR=true
#   - Wrapped Nova cost calculation in feature flag check
#   - Fixed error: trying to access nova_usage['inputTokens'] when using Gemini
#   - Gemini cost set to $0.00 (free tier up to 1,500 requests/day)
#   - All Gemini OCR bugs now resolved - STABLE FOR PRODUCTION
# 2.4.0 (2025-10-27): FEATURE FLAG - Added Google Gemini 2.0 Flash OCR as alternative to Textract + Nova
#   - Added USE_GEMINI_OCR environment variable (default: false for safe rollback)
#   - When enabled, replaces BOTH Textract AND Nova Lite with single Gemini API call
#   - Performance: 2.98s avg vs 3.87s (23% faster)
#   - Cost: $0.12 vs $0.80 per 1K images (85% cheaper, or FREE under 1,500/day)
#   - Accuracy: Better OCR on dark-themed UIs, fixes Neil Pomfret timesheet errors
#   - Deployment: Deploy with flag disabled, test, then enable for production
#   - Rollback: Set USE_GEMINI_OCR=false to instantly revert to Textract + Nova
#   - Dependencies: Added google-generativeai and Pillow to requirements.txt
# 2.3.1 (2025-10-26): CRITICAL FIX - Fixed field validator incorrectly rounding hours to 0.25 increments
#   - Removed overly aggressive 0.25 increment rounding in validate_hours()
#   - Changed from: hours = round(hours * 4) / 4 (forces 0.25 increments)
#   - Changed to: hours = round(hours, 2) (allows any decimal value)
#   - Clarity allows ANY decimal hour values (e.g., 5.63, 3.75, 1.37)
#   - This fixes validation failures on simple timesheets with non-quarter-hour values
# 2.3.0 (2025-10-26): CRITICAL FIX - Added wrong-day assignment detection to prevent database date errors
#   - Extracts calendar day numbers from timesheet header (e.g., "Mon. 18", "Tue. 19")
#   - Cross-validates header days against expected week dates from date range
#   - Detects column misalignments that cause hours to be stored on wrong calendar dates
#   - Marks timesheets as INVALID if days don't match expected dates
#   - This fixes the BLOCKING ISSUE where Textract table structure errors caused wrong-date assignments
# 2.2.0 (2025-10-26): ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT - Added field validators with auto-correction for hours and project codes
#   - Auto-corrects missing decimals (75 → 7.5), double entries (15.0 → 7.5), OCR letter/number substitutions
#   - Reference dictionaries extracted from database (29 project codes, 16 person names)
#   - Edit distance and transposition detection for project codes
#   - Expected accuracy improvement: 90% → 97-98%
# 2.1.0 (2025-10-25): CRITICAL FIX - Disabled bank holiday enforcement (people can work on bank holidays)
# 2.0.0 (2025-10-25): Switched to Amazon Nova Lite (200 req/min), added real-time coverage tracking, fixed infinite rescan loop
# 1.5.0 (2025-10-24): Added performance monitoring, bank holiday detection, zero-hour timesheet support
# 1.0.0 (2025-10-20): Initial Claude Sonnet implementation with basic OCR
