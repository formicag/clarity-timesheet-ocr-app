# Missing Timesheets Detection Guide

## Overview

The `find_missing_timesheets.py` script identifies which team members are missing timesheet submissions for specific weeks.

## How It Works

1. **Defines expected weeks** - Generates all Monday dates in your specified date range (weeks are Mon-Sun)
2. **Scans DynamoDB** - Finds all weeks that have been submitted (both regular and zero-hour timesheets)
3. **Compares** - For each team member, identifies which weeks are missing
4. **Reports** - Shows detailed list of missing weeks per person with summary statistics

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
python3 find_missing_timesheets.py START_DATE END_DATE
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 find_missing_timesheets.py 2025-09-01 2025-10-31
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python3 find_missing_timesheets.py
```
Then enter dates when prompted.

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS Credentials** - You must be logged in to AWS:
   ```bash
   aws sso login
   ```

2. **Team Roster** - The `team_roster.json` file must be up to date with all team members

3. **DynamoDB Access** - Script reads from `TimesheetOCR-dev` table

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Detects both regular and zero-hour timesheets** - Week is marked as "submitted" if either type exists

‚úÖ **Week-aligned to Monday-Sunday** - Automatically finds all Monday dates in range

‚úÖ **Full team coverage** - Checks all members from `team_roster.json`

‚úÖ **Detailed reporting** - Shows exactly which weeks are missing for each person

‚úÖ **Summary statistics** - Overall completion rate and totals

## Use Cases

### 1. Weekly Check
Check for missing timesheets from the past week:
```bash
python3 find_missing_timesheets.py 2025-10-20 2025-10-26
```

### 2. Monthly Report
Review full month:
```bash
python3 find_missing_timesheets.py 2025-10-01 2025-10-31
```

### 3. Quarter Review
Check entire quarter:
```bash
python3 find_missing_timesheets.py 2025-07-01 2025-09-30
```

## Understanding the Output

- **Submitted: 7/9 weeks** - Team member submitted 7 out of 9 expected weeks
- **Missing: 2 weeks** - 2 weeks have no timesheet (neither regular nor zero-hour)
- **‚ùå Date ranges** - Specific weeks missing (Monday to Sunday)
- **Completion rate** - Percentage of all expected timesheets that were submitted

## Notes

- Only checks team members in `team_roster.json`
- Zero-hour timesheets (annual leave, absence) count as submitted
- Weeks are always Monday (start) to Sunday (end)
- Date range is inclusive (both start and end dates included)

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Token has expired"**
```bash
aws sso login
```

**Error: "No team members found"**
- Check that `team_roster.json` exists and has valid data

**Wrong weeks shown**
- Make sure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Verify start date is before end date
