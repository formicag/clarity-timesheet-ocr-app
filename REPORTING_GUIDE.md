# Timesheet Reporting System Guide

## Overview

The Timesheet OCR system now includes comprehensive reporting capabilities to track which weeks have been submitted for each resource, including handling of zero-hour timesheets (annual leave, absences).

## New Features

### 1. Zero-Hour Timesheet Detection

The system now automatically detects when a timesheet has 0% project time logged (indicating annual leave or absence) and tracks these submissions separately.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Detects timesheets with 0% project time
- Identifies reason (ANNUAL_LEAVE or ABSENCE)
- Stores a single record to track the week was submitted
- Shows as "Zero Hour" in reports with an orange indicator

**Example Zero-Hour Timesheets:**
- Employee on annual leave for the week
- Employee absent for the week
- Any timesheet showing 0% in the top-right corner

### 2. Per-Person Calendar Reports

Generate visual calendar reports showing:
- **Green checkmark**: Week has timesheet data
- **Orange warning**: Week has zero-hour timesheet (leave/absence)
- **Red cross**: Week is missing timesheet submission

### 3. Gap Detection

The system identifies missing weeks by:
1. Finding the earliest timesheet submission date
2. Generating all calendar weeks from that date to present
3. Marking weeks without submissions as "missing"
4. Calculating completion percentage

## API Endpoints

## Database Schema

### DynamoDB Table: TimesheetOCR-{Environment}

**Primary Key:**
- Partition Key: `ResourceName` (e.g., "Barry_Breden")
- Sort Key: `DateProjectCode` (e.g., "2025-09-29#PJ023275")

**For zero-hour timesheets:**
- Sort Key: `WEEK#{start_date}` (e.g., "WEEK#2025-09-15")

**Key Attributes:**
- `ResourceName`: Resource identifier (underscored)
- `ResourceNameDisplay`: Display name (with spaces)
- `Date`: Date of entry (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `WeekStartDate`: Monday of the week (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `WeekEndDate`: Sunday of the week (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `IsZeroHourTimesheet`: Boolean flag
- `ZeroHourReason`: "ANNUAL_LEAVE" or "ABSENCE"
- `ProjectCode`: Project code (empty for zero-hour)
- `ProjectName`: Project name (empty for zero-hour)
- `Hours`: Hours logged (0 for zero-hour)
- `SourceImage`: S3 key of uploaded screenshot

**Global Secondary Indexes:**
1. `ProjectCodeIndex`: Query by project
2. `YearMonthIndex`: Query by month

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. AWS CLI configured
2. SAM CLI installed
3. Python 3.13+ environment

### Deploy the Updated Stack

```bash
# Build
sam build

# Deploy to dev environment
sam deploy \
  --stack-name timesheet-ocr-dev \
  --parameter-overrides Environment=dev \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --resolve-s3

# Get outputs including API URL
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name timesheet-ocr-dev \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
```

### Environment Variables

The system automatically sets:
- `DYNAMODB_TABLE`: Table name for timesheet data
- `MODEL_ID`: Claude model ID for OCR
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Deployment environment

## Usage Examples

### 1. Upload a Zero-Hour Timesheet

Simply upload the screenshot as normal:

```bash
# Copy screenshot to S3
aws s3 cp "Screenshots/2025-10-20_15h54_43.png" \
  s3://timesheetocr-input-dev-{ACCOUNT_ID}/2025-10-20_15h54_43.png
```

The system will automatically:
1. Detect it's a zero-hour timesheet (0% shown)
2. Extract the resource name and date range
3. Store a single record with `IsZeroHourTimesheet: true`
4. Include it in reports with orange indicator

### 2. View All Resources

```bash
# Get list of all people who have submitted timesheets
curl https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/resources | jq .
```

### 3. Check Completion Status

```bash
# Get JSON report
curl "https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/report/Barry%20Breden" | jq .statistics

# Output:
# {
#   "total_weeks": 10,
#   "weeks_present": 7,
#   "weeks_missing": 3,
#   "zero_hour_weeks": 1,
#   "completion_percentage": 70.0
# }
```

### 4. View Visual Report

Open in your browser:
```bash
# macOS
open "https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/report/Barry%20Breden/html"

# Linux
xdg-open "https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/report/Barry%20Breden/html"

# Windows
start "https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/report/Barry%20Breden/html"
```

### 5. Export Report Data

```bash
# Save JSON report to file
curl "https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/report/Barry%20Breden" > report.json

# Save HTML report
curl "https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/report/Barry%20Breden/html" > report.html
```

## Local Testing

### Test Zero-Hour Detection

```bash
python3 test_zero_hour_detection.py
```

### Test Report Generation Locally

```python
# Set environment variable
export DYNAMODB_TABLE=TimesheetOCR-dev

# Run report function locally
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from report_lambda import lambda_handler

event = {
    'path': '/resources',
    'httpMethod': 'GET',
    'queryStringParameters': None
}

result = lambda_handler(event, None)
print(result)
"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Zero-hour timesheet not detected

**Check:**
1. Timesheet shows 0% in top-right corner
2. No project hours are logged
3. Review Lambda logs for OCR output

**Solution:**
The prompt explicitly looks for 0% project time. If the timesheet has any hours logged, it won't be classified as zero-hour.

### Issue: Missing weeks showing incorrectly

**Check:**
1. Verify the date range in query parameters
2. Check if there are any entries for that resource
3. Ensure WeekStartDate is set correctly (Mondays)

**Solution:**
The system generates all weeks from the earliest submission to today. If a resource has very old data, consider using `start_date` parameter.

### Issue: Report API returns 404

**Check:**
1. API Gateway deployed correctly
2. Lambda function has correct permissions
3. Resource name is URL-encoded (spaces as %20)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check API exists
aws apigateway get-rest-apis --query 'items[?name==`TimesheetOCR-API-dev`]'

# Check Lambda function
aws lambda get-function --function-name TimesheetOCR-report-dev
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Email notifications for missing weeks
2. Bulk report generation for all resources
3. Export to Excel/PDF
4. Team-level dashboards
5. Trend analysis (hours over time)
6. Project allocation reports

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda functions
2. Review DynamoDB table contents
3. Verify IAM permissions
4. Check API Gateway configuration
