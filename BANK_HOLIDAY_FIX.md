# Bank Holiday Fix Implementation

## Problem
The OCR system was incorrectly assigning 7.5 hours to bank holidays that should have 0 hours. For example, the timesheet `2025-10-21_17h20_34.png` for the week of Aug 25-31, 2025 had Monday Aug 25 (UK Summer bank holiday) filled with 7.5 hours instead of 0.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive bank holiday detection and enforcement system.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Module: `src/bank_holidays.py`
Created a new module that contains:
- Complete list of UK bank holidays for 2025
- Helper functions to check if a date is a bank holiday
- Week validation to identify bank holidays within a timesheet week
- Holiday name lookups

**UK Bank Holidays 2025:**
- Jan 01 (Wed) - New Year's Day
- Apr 18 (Fri) - Good Friday
- Apr 21 (Mon) - Easter Monday
- May 05 (Mon) - Early May bank holiday
- May 26 (Mon) - Spring bank holiday
- **Aug 25 (Mon) - Summer bank holiday** ‚≠ê (the problem case)
- Dec 25 (Thu) - Christmas Day
- Dec 26 (Fri) - Boxing Day

### 2. Updated: `src/prompt.py`
Enhanced the OCR prompt to include:
- Explicit list of UK bank holidays for 2025
- Instructions that bank holidays MUST have 0 hours
- Detection of OCR errors where hours are shown on bank holidays
- Example specifically mentioning Aug 25, 2025

**Key prompt additions:**
```
**UK Bank Holidays - CRITICAL**: Some days may be UK bank holidays where NO WORK should be logged.

**BANK HOLIDAY RULES**:
1. If a day in the timesheet falls on a UK bank holiday, hours MUST be 0 for that day
2. Bank holidays are typically shown as EMPTY cells in the timesheet (not filled in)
3. If you see hours recorded on a bank holiday, this is an OCR ERROR - correct it to 0
4. Example: Week of Aug 25-31, 2025 includes Monday Aug 25 (bank holiday)
   - Monday Aug 25 should have 0 hours (bank holiday)
   - Even if the cell appears filled, set Monday hours to 0
```

### 3. Updated: `src/parsing.py`
Added post-processing validation:
- New function `enforce_bank_holiday_rules()` that runs after JSON parsing
- Automatically corrects any hours recorded on bank holidays to 0
- Applies corrections to both project hours and daily totals
- Recalculates weekly totals after corrections
- Provides detailed logging of corrections made

**Example output:**
```
üè¶ Bank Holiday Detected: Monday Aug 25, 2025 - Summer bank holiday
   Correcting daily total from 7.5 to 0
   Correcting Future Back 3G (36 series) from 7.5 to 0
   Recalculating weekly total from 30.0 to 22.5
```

### 4. Updated: `timesheet_ui.py`
Added visual indicator to the UI:
- Green checkmark (‚úì) indicator in the title bar
- Text: "2025 UK Bank Holidays Enabled"
- Clearly shows users that bank holiday detection is active

**Visual appearance:**
```
üìä Timesheet OCR Processor  [‚úì 2025 UK Bank Holidays Enabled]
```

## Testing

### Test Script: `test_bank_holiday.py`
Created a comprehensive test script that:
1. Invokes Lambda to reprocess the problem timesheet (`2025-10-21_17h20_34.png`)
2. Displays the extracted data
3. Validates that Monday Aug 25 has 0 hours
4. Validates that all projects have 0 hours on Monday Aug 25
5. Shows clear pass/fail results

**To run the test:**
```bash
python3 test_bank_holiday.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Monday Aug 25 (bank holiday) correctly has 0 hours
‚úÖ All projects correctly have 0 hours on Monday Aug 25 (bank holiday)
```

## Deployment

### Deployment Script: `deploy_bank_holiday_fix.sh`
Created automated deployment script that:
1. Packages all source files including the new bank_holidays.py
2. Creates a zip file
3. Updates the Lambda function code
4. Waits for the update to complete

**To deploy:**
```bash
./deploy_bank_holiday_fix.sh
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before deploying:** Ensure you're logged into AWS SSO with the correct browser and user.

## How It Works

### Two-Layer Defense

**Layer 1: OCR Prompt**
- Claude is explicitly told about bank holidays during OCR
- Instructed to set hours to 0 for bank holidays
- Given specific examples (Aug 25, 2025)

**Layer 2: Post-Processing Validation**
- After OCR extraction, the `enforce_bank_holiday_rules()` function runs
- Checks if any days in the timesheet week are bank holidays
- Forces hours to 0 for those days, regardless of what OCR extracted
- This catches cases where the prompt instructions weren't perfectly followed

### Data Flow
```
Image ‚Üí OCR (with bank holiday awareness) ‚Üí JSON Response ‚Üí
enforce_bank_holiday_rules() ‚Üí Corrected Data ‚Üí DynamoDB
```

## Example: Aug 25-31, 2025 Timesheet

**Before fix:**
```json
{
  "date_range": "Aug 25 2025 - Aug 31 2025",
  "daily_totals": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 0, 0, 0],
  "weekly_total": 30.0,
  "projects": [{
    "project_name": "Future Back 3G (36 series)",
    "hours_by_day": [
      {"day": "Monday", "hours": "7.5"},  ‚ùå Wrong!
      {"day": "Tuesday", "hours": "7.5"},
      ...
    ]
  }]
}
```

**After fix:**
```json
{
  "date_range": "Aug 25 2025 - Aug 31 2025",
  "daily_totals": [0, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5, 0, 0, 0],  ‚úÖ Monday = 0
  "weekly_total": 22.5,  ‚úÖ Corrected from 30.0
  "projects": [{
    "project_name": "Future Back 3G (36 series)",
    "hours_by_day": [
      {"day": "Monday", "hours": "0"},  ‚úÖ Corrected!
      {"day": "Tuesday", "hours": "7.5"},
      ...
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Files Modified

- ‚úèÔ∏è `src/parsing.py` (MODIFIED)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fix:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy_bank_holiday_fix.sh
   ```

2. **Test with the problem timesheet:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_bank_holiday.py
   ```

3. **Verify in UI:**
   - Launch the UI: `python3 timesheet_ui.py`
   - Check for the green "‚úì 2025 UK Bank Holidays Enabled" indicator
   - Upload and process timesheets that fall on bank holidays

4. **Reprocess existing incorrect data:**
   - Any timesheets already in DynamoDB with incorrect bank holiday hours can be reprocessed
   - Simply re-upload the images or trigger Lambda manually with the S3 keys
   - The new logic will correct the hours automatically

## Validation

The system validates bank holidays at multiple points:
1. ‚úÖ OCR prompt explicitly lists all bank holidays
2. ‚úÖ Post-processing enforces 0 hours on bank holidays
3. ‚úÖ Validation report shows corrections made
4. ‚úÖ UI indicator confirms bank holiday detection is active
5. ‚úÖ Test script validates specific problematic cases

## Notes

- The bank holiday list is hardcoded for 2025
- For 2026 and beyond, the list in `src/bank_holidays.py` will need to be updated
- All bank holidays are checked against the official UK government list
- The system handles edge cases like weeks spanning multiple months
- Corrections are logged for transparency and debugging
