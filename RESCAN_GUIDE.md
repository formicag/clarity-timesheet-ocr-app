# Re-scan Failed Images Guide

## Overview

Your timesheet OCR system now includes functionality to automatically identify and re-process images that failed during initial processing.

## What Was Added

### 1. **Automatic Failure Detection**
- Compares S3 bucket images with DynamoDB records
- Identifies images that have no corresponding database entries (failed to process)
- Tracks success rates and provides detailed reports

### 2. **Re-processing Scripts**

#### `find_failed_images.py`
Identifies all failed images and saves list to `failed_images.json`

```bash
python3 find_failed_images.py
```

**Output:**
- Total images in S3
- Successfully processed count
- Failed images count
- Success rate percentage
- List saved to `failed_images.json`

#### `reprocess_failed.py`
Re-processes all failed images listed in `failed_images.json`

```bash
python3 reprocess_failed.py
```

**Features:**
- Reads `failed_images.json`
- Triggers Lambda for each failed image
- Shows real-time progress
- Saves detailed results
- Provides success/failure summary

### 3. **UI Button: "ðŸ”„ Re-scan Failed Images"**

Added to the main UI (row 2, spans columns 0-1)

**What it does:**
1. Scans S3 bucket for all images
2. Checks DynamoDB for processed images
3. Identifies failed images
4. Shows summary dialog with statistics
5. Asks for confirmation before re-processing
6. Re-processes all failed images with progress updates
7. Shows final summary and auto-refreshes data

## How to Use

### Method 1: Using the UI (Recommended)

1. Open the timesheet UI:
   ```bash
   python3 timesheet_ui.py
   ```

2. Click **"ðŸ”„ Re-scan Failed Images"** button

3. Review the summary dialog:
   - Total images in S3
   - Successfully processed
   - Failed images count
   - Success rate

4. Click **"Yes"** to proceed with re-processing

5. Wait for completion (progress shown in log window)

6. Review final summary dialog

### Method 2: Using Command Line Scripts

**Step 1: Find failed images**
```bash
python3 find_failed_images.py
```

**Step 2: Review the list**
```bash
cat failed_images.json
```

**Step 3: Re-process failed images**
```bash
python3 reprocess_failed.py
```

## Understanding the Results

### Current Status (as of last scan)
- **Total images in S3:** 353
- **Successfully processed:** 108
- **Failed to process:** 245
- **Success rate:** 30.6%

This means **245 images** need to be re-processed with the fixed code.

### After Re-processing (Expected)

With the bug fixes now deployed, the success rate should improve to **85-90%**.

**Remaining failures** (~10%) are typically due to:
- OCR misreading years (2020 instead of 2025)
- Severely malformed data
- Very poor image quality

## Files Created

1. **`failed_images.json`** - List of failed images with metadata
   - Created by: `find_failed_images.py`
   - Contains: Image keys, sizes, last modified dates

2. **`reprocess_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`** - Re-processing results
   - Created by: `reprocess_failed.py`
   - Contains: Success/failure counts, error details

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'boto3'"
Make sure you have AWS SDK installed:
```bash
pip3 install boto3
```

### "Token has expired"
Login to AWS SSO:
```bash
aws sso login
```

### "Failed to find images"
Check AWS credentials and permissions:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **S3 Scan**: Lists all `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` files in the input bucket
2. **DynamoDB Scan**: Gets all unique `SourceImage` values
3. **Comparison**: Finds images in S3 that don't have DB records
4. **Re-processing**: Triggers Lambda function for each failed image
5. **Tracking**: Only successfully processed images are in DB

### Why Images Fail

**Before Fixes (40% success rate):**
- Date formats with commas: `Aug 25, 2025`
- Weeks not starting on Monday
- Duplicate database keys
- European date formats: `03.13.2023`

**After Fixes (85-90% expected success rate):**
- All date format variations supported
- Auto-correction for non-Monday starts
- Duplicate detection and deduplication
- Multiple date format parsers

**Still Failing (~10%):**
- OCR errors (wrong years, dates)
- Extremely poor image quality
- Malformed timesheet data

## Next Steps

1. **Run Re-scan**: Click the button or run the scripts
2. **Review Results**: Check which images still fail
3. **Manual Review**: For images that still fail after re-scan:
   - Check image quality
   - Verify timesheet format
   - Consider manual data entry

## Benefits

âœ… **Automatic**: No manual tracking of failed images
âœ… **Complete**: Processes ALL failed images, not just recent ones
âœ… **Incremental**: Only processes images not in database
âœ… **Safe**: Can be run multiple times without duplicating data
âœ… **Fast**: Processes images in parallel with progress tracking
âœ… **Visible**: Real-time progress in UI log window

## Maintenance

- Run re-scan after deploying OCR improvements
- Run periodically to catch any missed images
- Keep backups before large re-processing runs
- Monitor success rates over time
