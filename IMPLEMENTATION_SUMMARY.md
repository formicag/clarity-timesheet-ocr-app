# Implementation Summary: Zero-Hour Timesheets & Reporting System

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive reporting system for your timesheet OCR application that:
1. **Detects and handles zero-hour timesheets** (annual leave, absences)
2. **Tracks which weeks have been submitted** per resource
3. **Shows gaps in data** with visual indicators
4. **Provides beautiful HTML calendar reports** with color-coded status

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. OCR Prompt Updates (`src/prompt.py`)

**Changes:**
- Added zero-hour timesheet detection instructions
- Claude now identifies timesheets with 0% project time
- Extracts reason for zero hours (ANNUAL_LEAVE or ABSENCE)
- Returns `is_zero_hour_timesheet` and `zero_hour_reason` fields in JSON

**How it works:**
- When processing screenshot "2025-10-20_15h54_43.png" (0% timesheet), Claude detects no hours logged
- Sets `is_zero_hour_timesheet: true` and `zero_hour_reason: "ANNUAL_LEAVE"`
- Allows empty projects array for zero-hour timesheets

### 2. DynamoDB Schema Updates (`src/dynamodb_handler.py`)

**Changes:**
- Added `IsZeroHourTimesheet` boolean field to all entries
- Added `ZeroHourReason` field for zero-hour entries
- Zero-hour timesheets create a single record with sort key `WEEK#{date}`
- Regular timesheets create records for each project/day combination

**Table Structure:**
```
ResourceName (PK)  | DateProjectCode (SK)          | IsZeroHourTimesheet | Hours
-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------
Barry_Breden       | WEEK#2025-09-15               | true                | 0
Barry_Breden       | 2025-09-22#PJ023275           | false               | 7.5
Barry_Breden       | 2025-09-23#PJ023275           | false               | 22.5
```

**Benefits:**
- Tracks that a week was submitted even with 0 hours
- Distinguishes between "no submission" and "zero-hour submission"
- Enables accurate completion percentage calculations

### 3. New Reporting Module (`src/reporting.py`)

**Functions:**
- `get_all_resources()`: List all people who have submitted timesheets
- `get_resource_week_summary()`: Get all weeks with data for a person
- `generate_calendar_weeks()`: Generate all weeks in a date range
- `generate_resource_calendar_report()`: Complete calendar with gaps identified

**Features:**
- Groups data by week (Monday-Sunday)
- Identifies missing weeks between submissions
- Calculates statistics (total weeks, submitted, missing, zero-hour)
- Returns structured data for both JSON and HTML rendering

### 4. Report Lambda Function (`src/report_lambda.py`)

**API Routes:**
1. `GET /resources` - List all resources
2. `GET /report/{resource_name}` - Get JSON report
3. `GET /report/{resource_name}/html` - Get HTML report

**Query Parameters:**
- `start_date`: Filter from this date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `end_date`: Filter to this date (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# List all people
curl https://api-url/dev/resources

# Get Barry's report
curl "https://api-url/dev/report/Barry%20Breden"

# Get HTML report for date range
curl "https://api-url/dev/report/Barry%20Breden/html?start_date=2025-09-01"
```

### 5. HTML Report Generator (`src/report_html.py`)

**Features:**
- Beautiful responsive design with gradient header
- Color-coded week cards:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Timesheet submitted (with hours and projects)
  - ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Zero-hour timesheet (leave/absence)
  - ðŸ”´ **Red**: Missing submission
- Statistics dashboard showing:
  - Total weeks tracked
  - Weeks with submissions
  - Missing weeks
  - Zero-hour weeks
  - Completion percentage
- Grouped by month for easy navigation
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Hover effects and animations

**Visual Indicators:**
- âœ“ Green checkmark for submitted weeks
- âš  Orange warning for zero-hour weeks
- âœ— Red cross for missing weeks

### 6. CloudFormation Template Updates (`template.yaml`)

**New Resources:**

1. **DynamoDB Table** (`TimesheetTable`)
   - PAY_PER_REQUEST billing
   - Two Global Secondary Indexes (ProjectCodeIndex, YearMonthIndex)
   - Encryption enabled
   - Point-in-time recovery for production

2. **Report Lambda Function** (`ReportFunction`)
   - Handles API requests
   - Read-only DynamoDB access
   - CloudWatch logging

3. **API Gateway** (`ReportApi`)
   - RESTful API with CORS enabled
   - Three routes configured
   - Deployed to environment stage

**Updated Resources:**
- OCR Lambda now has `DYNAMODB_TABLE` environment variable
- Added DynamoDB CRUD permissions to OCR function
- Added log group for report function

**New Outputs:**
- `DynamoDBTableName`: Table name for queries
- `ReportApiUrl`: Base URL for API
- `ReportApiId`: API Gateway ID

## How Zero-Hour Timesheets Work

### Example: Barry Breden on Annual Leave

**Input:** Screenshot showing:
- Resource: Barry Breden
- Week: Sep 15 2025 - Sep 21 2025
- Status: Posted
- Project Time: **0%** (top-right corner)
- No project entries

**OCR Processing:**
```json
{
  "resource_name": "Barry Breden",
  "date_range": "Sep 15 2025 - Sep 21 2025",
  "is_zero_hour_timesheet": true,
  "zero_hour_reason": "ANNUAL_LEAVE",
  "projects": []
}
```

**Database Entry:**
```json
{
  "ResourceName": "Barry_Breden",
  "DateProjectCode": "WEEK#2025-09-15",
  "Date": "2025-09-15",
  "WeekStartDate": "2025-09-15",
  "WeekEndDate": "2025-09-21",
  "IsZeroHourTimesheet": true,
  "ZeroHourReason": "ANNUAL_LEAVE",
  "ResourceNameDisplay": "Barry Breden",
  "SourceImage": "2025-10-20_15h54_43.png",
  ...
}
```

**Report Display:**
- Week card has **orange border**
- Badge shows "Zero Hour (ANNUAL_LEAVE)"
- Status: "Annual Leave / Absence"
- Counts as **submitted** (not missing)

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What happens if someone uploads the same week twice?**
A: The system overwrites with the newest data (duplicate detection already exists).

**Q: Can I see reports for a specific date range?**
A: Yes, use `?start_date=2025-09-01&end_date=2025-12-31` query parameters.

**Q: How do I know if someone is on leave vs forgot to submit?**
A: Orange indicator = on leave (zero-hour submission). Red cross = no submission at all.

**Q: Can I export the report data?**
A: Yes, save the JSON response to file and process with Excel/Python/etc.

**Q: Does this work with existing data?**
A: Yes for regular timesheets. Existing zero-hour timesheets won't have the flag set unless re-uploaded.

**Q: What if a timesheet has some hours but less than usual?**
A: It's treated as a normal submission, not zero-hour. Zero-hour specifically means 0% project time.
